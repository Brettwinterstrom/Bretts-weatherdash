For my weather dashboard I have a search text area for a user to input a city they want to see the weather for. Upon click of the search button we pull data from the openweathermap API with an AJAX call and display the weather conditions we selected for. We then go ahead and pull more data from the openweathermap API with an AJAX call to show the 5-day forecast for the city the user input.
